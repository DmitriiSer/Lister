# Lister
### Version: 0.1.4
Lister is a mobile-ready, natively looking, AngularJS and Ionic powered HTML5 todo organizer.

##### Main specifications:
  - *All the lists are stored on a server*
  - ~~Fast syncronization between all the devices~~

##### Tech:

Lister uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web
* [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) - Ionic is the beautiful. open source front-end SDK for developing hybrid mobile apps with web technologies
* [Font Awesome Icons](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) - The complete set of 605 icons in Font Awesome 4.5.0
* [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) - Bootstrap components written in pure [AngularJS] by the [AngularUI Team](http://angular-ui.github.io/)
* [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/) - Accelerated JavaScript animation
* [textarea-caret-position](https://github.com/component/textarea-caret-position) - Get the top and left coordinates of the caret in a [textarea] or [input type="text"], in pixels
* [SHA-3](https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#SHA-3) - SHA-3 is the winner of a five-year competition to select a new cryptographic hash algorithm where 64 competing designs were evaluated

And of course **Lister** itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/DmitriiSer/Lister)
 on GitHub.
